        For the last project of the first semester of my final year of the BA in Communication Design, we were
        challenged to design a publication choosing one of the themes proposed by our teachers.

      <p>
        In collaboration with Carlos Trabulo, I designed Ignite Magazine, a magazine that explores different
        sides of technology and it’s impact on society, cutlure and individuals.

        This issue - The Bubble Issue - focuses on Algorithms, Bubble Filter and Bubble Vision. It aims at
        making tangible invisible concepts and alert the readers for the problems with lack of information
        and clarity in their own explanation and how this unawareness contributes to the creation of an
        algorithmic culture.

        The publication is compilled with a series of educational articles about the topic and original illustrations
        that bring to life these “invisible concepts”. The website was made in Cargo and has the digital version of
        the publication.
