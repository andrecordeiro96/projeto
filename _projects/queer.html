        For the last project of my artistic highschool we had a special exam called PAA (Prova de Aptidão Artística)
        where we had to develop a personal final project based on the specialty we had chosen for our course.
        Mine was Graphic Design.
        And so I redesigned the visual brand and identity of the 22nd Edition of the Queer cinema festival QUEER LISBOA.
        Looking back I was very green and the project had many flaws. I love it regardless, I had a lot of fun.

        I designed the logo for the festival giving it a new identity, 4 original illustrations for MUPI’s
        around the city of Lisbon as part of the advertisement campaign and a mockup website for this edition
        of the festival.

        It was important for me to do illustrations that felt diverse, inclusive but also somewhat educative,
        by using metaphors like the unicorn among the black and white chess pieces and the colorful van between
        the cars, these contrasts of color were meant to celebrate whats out of the norm, and a way to explain what
        it means to be queer to the general public.
