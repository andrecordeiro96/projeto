      I’m a recent graduate from the post-graduate course in Digital Experience Design and also a graduate from
      the bachelor of Communication Design both at the Fine-Arts Academy part of University of Lisbon (FBAUL).

      I’m interested in Design and User Experience and how designers have the ability to better the lives of the
      people around us.

      I’m very eager to design customer-focused interfaces such as checkout and digital sales and how to better
      these experiences.
